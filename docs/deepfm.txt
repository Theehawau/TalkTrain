DeepFM¶

Introduction¶
DeepFM is an improved model with FM module added on the basis of WideAndDeep. The FM module and the DNN module share the same feature, that is, the same Embedding.



Configuration instructions¶
model_config: {
   model_class: "DeepFM"
   feature_groups: {
     group_name: "deep"
     feature_names: "hour"
     feature_names: "c1"
     ...
     feature_names: "site_id_app_id"
     wide_deep: DEEP
   }
   feature_groups: {
     group_name: "wide"
     feature_names: "hour"
     feature_names: "c1"
     ...
     feature_names: "c21"
     wide_deep: WIDE
   }

   deepfm {
     wide_output_dim: 16

     dnn {
       hidden_units: [128, 64, 32]
     }

     final_dnn {
       hidden_units: [128, 64]
     }
     l2_regularization: 1e-5
   }
   embedding_regularization: 1e-7
}



model_class: 'DeepFM', no modification required
feature_groups:
Two feature_groups are required: wide group and deep group, group name cannot be changed

deepfm: parameters related to deepfm
dnn: parameter configuration of deep part

hidden_units: The number of channels in each layer of dnn, that is, the number of neurons


wide_output_dim: the size of the output of the wide part
final_dnn: Integrate the parameter input of wide part, fm part and deep part, you can choose whether to use it

hidden_units: The number of channels in each layer of dnn, that is, the number of neurons


embedding_regularization: Add regularization to the embedding part to prevent overfit
